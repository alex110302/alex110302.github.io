            <p id="infotext">My name is Alex and I am from Whitewater WI (there is nothing there but a college and some bars). <br>
                I moved up here because why not? I wanted to move up here to live with my girlfriend and also to move away from home and do something new. I had tried sys admin degree at Madison Area Tech <br> originally
                but I was already pretty burnt out of school from high school and I ended up not liking the degree so I dropped it and took a year off from school. and that when I moved up here <br>
                I like it much better up here. And I really like programming, I had done a bunch of classes in high school but wasn't good at them (aka I just didn't do my homework) but I still liked the idea of coding. <br>
                See I care now about what I want to do and I really do like programming tho I wish I had worked on it more during the summer... I'm rambling now.</p>
